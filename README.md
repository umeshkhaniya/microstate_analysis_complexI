# Microstate Analysis ComplexI

The Jupyter Notebook file contains the analysis of large datasets of microstates obtained from a Monte Carlo run for the E-channel and antiporter channel of complex I. This analysis will help identify the loading and unloading states of the protein structure. It will also assist in determining the input protonation state for molecular dynamics simulation.
