# microstate_analysis_complexI

Jupyter notebook file has the analysis of large data sets of microstates file obtained from monte carlo run for E-channel and antiporter channel of complex I.
This analysis will help to find out the loading and unloading states for protein structure. This will also helps to give input protonation state for Molecular dyanamics simulation.
